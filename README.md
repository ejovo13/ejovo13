Welcome to my profile! 

I'm interested in numerical analysis and scientific computing. I am currently working as a Research Assistant in the Physics department of Kalamazoo college, working with C, Fortran, and MATLAB to perform normal mode analysis on virus capsids.

I'm currently learning the Fortran programming language by working through the exercises (and congregating some of the more useful procedures into my own modules)
of the book: [Fortran for Scientists and Engineers.](https://www.amazon.com/FORTRAN-SCIENTISTS-ENGINEERS-Stephen-Chapman/dp/0073385891). To gain a deeper understanding of the topic of numerical analysis, I am implementing basic Linear Algebra algorithms (Gram-Schmidt, Gauss Elimination, Iterative Algorithms) to solve systems of linear equations, using Fortran.

I'm proficient in MATLAB and Java programming.

I'm looking to expand my skills in the world of scientific computing and broadening my horizons by exploring a purely functional language like Haskell, and a modern language like Julia.
